# Sprint 2-A: Animation & UX Refinement

## Objective:
Refine the customer flow to align with the "promotional, storytelling format" of `Animation-flow.md`, focusing on smooth, modern, and friendly micro-interactions.

### Atomic Tasks:

- [ ] **Homepage (`/`):**
    - [ ] Redesign the homepage to act as a cleaner, more inviting entry point, reflecting the "Scan. Order. Enjoy." concept.
    - [ ] Ensure the primary CTA ("Simulate Scan for Table...") is prominent and inviting.
    - [ ] Use the brand's "QR Flow Symbol" logo effectively.

- [ ] **Menu Item Animation (`MenuItemCard.tsx`):**
    - [ ] Add a subtle, staggered fade-in animation for menu item cards as they appear on the screen to make browsing feel more fluid and less abrupt.

- [ ] **Order Tracking Animation (`OrderStatusTracker.tsx`):**
    - [ ] Enhance the progress bar animation. The connecting line should fill smoothly with an animated stroke from left to right as the status progresses.
    - [ ] Add a subtle "bounce" effect to the active status icon to give it life.

- [ ] **Order Confirmation Polish (`/order/[orderId]`):**
    - [ ] Make the confirmation page more celebratory as per the wireframe, adding a "🎉" icon to the "Order Received!" message.
    - [ ] Ensure the page immediately provides clear, reassuring information (Order ID, status).

- [ ] **Final Design Direction Review:**
    - [ ] Ensure all changes contribute to a **Fast**, **Clean**, **Modern**, and **Friendly** user experience.
