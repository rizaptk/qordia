# Sprint 2-A: Animation & UX Refinement

## Objective:
Refine the customer flow to align with the "promotional, storytelling format" of `Animation-flow.md`, focusing on smooth, modern, and friendly micro-interactions on the actual customer-facing pages.

### Atomic Tasks:

- [ ] **Menu Page Polish (`/menu/[tableId]`):**
    - [ ] Make the menu page feel more welcoming and dynamic upon load, reflecting the "Browse. Customize. Order." concept.
    - [ ] Add a subtle, staggered fade-in animation for menu item cards as they appear on the screen to make browsing feel more fluid and less abrupt.

- [ ] **Order Tracking Animation (`OrderStatusTracker.tsx`):**
    - [ ] Enhance the progress bar animation. The connecting line should fill smoothly with an animated stroke from left to right as the status progresses.
    - [ ] Add a subtle "pulse" or "bounce" effect to the active status icon to give it life and draw attention.

- [ ] **Order Confirmation Polish (`/order/[orderId]`):**
    - [ ] Ensure the confirmation page is celebratory as per the wireframe, using the "🎉" icon and providing clear, reassuring information (Order ID, status) immediately. (This is mostly complete, but needs review).

- [ ] **Final Design Direction Review:**
    - [ ] Ensure all changes contribute to a **Fast**, **Clean**, **Modern**, and **Friendly** user experience.
