# Sprint 8: Final Polish

## Objective:
Apply final design touches and conduct a last review to ensure the application is cohesive and aligns with the brand vision.

### Atomic Tasks:
- [x] **Logo Implementation:** Replace the placeholder SVG in `src/components/logo.tsx` with a proper SVG representation of the "QR Flow Symbol" concept from `CONCEPT.md`. The new logo should reflect a stylized 'Q' with QR-code elements.
- [ ] **Dynamic Platform Dashboard:** Replace the hardcoded metrics on the `/platform` dashboard with live data aggregated from Firestore (e.g., count of tenants, count of users).
- [ ] **UX Review:** Perform a quick, final walkthrough of the core user flows (Customer Ordering, Staff PDS, Manager Dashboard) to identify and fix any minor UI inconsistencies or awkward interactions.
- [ ] **Code Cleanup:** Remove any remaining `console.log` statements or unused mock data that might have been left over from development.
