# Qordia — How The App Works

## 📱 Overview

Qordia is a QR-based self-ordering and operational platform designed primarily for cafés, coffee shops, food courts, and small restaurants. It transforms traditional counter or table ordering into a seamless digital dining experience.

The system allows customers to scan a QR code at their table or seating area to browse menus, place orders, and send them directly to the preparation station while businesses manage orders, preparation workflow, and service operations in real time.

Qordia is built to help smaller hospitality businesses serve customers faster, reduce queue congestion, and improve daily operational efficiency without adding complexity.

# ☕ Customer Experience Flow

## 1. Arriving at the Seating Area

When customers sit at a table or seating area, they will find a unique QR code placed on the table or near the seating location. Each QR code is linked to a specific table or seating zone inside the café or food court system.

This allows Qordia to automatically identify:

- The customer’s seating location
- The outlet or tenant location
- The available menu and pricing

Customers do not need to install any application. Scanning the QR code opens the digital ordering interface directly in their mobile browser.

This approach helps cafés and food courts reduce long ordering queues, especially during peak hours.

---

## 2. Opening the Digital Menu

After scanning the QR code, customers are redirected to the Qordia ordering page where they can:

- Browse categorized menus (coffee, beverages, snacks, meals, desserts)
- View images, descriptions, and pricing
- Check item availability in real time
- Customize orders (sugar level, ice level, toppings, milk options, spice level, add-ons)

Menus are designed to be mobile-friendly, fast-loading, and easy to navigate — ideal for quick ordering environments like coffee shops and food courts.

---

## 3. Adding Items to the Order

Customers can select multiple items and adjust quantities before adding them to their order cart.

The cart allows customers to:

- Review selected items
- Modify quantities
- Add special preparation notes
- See estimated total pricing

This helps reduce ordering mistakes and ensures preparation accuracy for drink and food customization.

---

## 4. Confirming the Order

Once customers confirm their order:

- The order is instantly sent to the café or preparation station
- The order is automatically linked to the correct table or seating zone
- The system assigns timestamps and order tracking status

Customers may optionally:

- Enter their name
- Place group orders
- Select payment preference (if enabled)

---

## 5. Order Tracking

Customers can monitor their order progress in real time through status updates such as:

- Order received
- Preparing drinks or food
- Ready for pickup or serving
- Completed

This reduces customer uncertainty and minimizes the need to repeatedly ask staff about order progress.

# 🧑‍🍳 Business Operational Workflow

## 1. Order Reception

When a customer submits an order:

- The order appears instantly in the Qordia dashboard
- Orders are automatically categorized by preparation station (barista, kitchen, beverage station, etc.)
- Orders are organized by preparation priority and time

This reduces manual order taking and helps small café teams operate more efficiently.

---

## 2. Preparation Display System

Staff can view incoming orders through a preparation display interface that shows:

- Item breakdown
- Customization notes
- Table or seating reference
- Order queue management
- Preparation status updates

Baristas and kitchen staff can update order progress directly from their preparation screen.

---

## 3. Serving and Pickup Coordination

Once items are ready:

- Staff can serve orders directly to tables
- Orders can be marked as ready for pickup (common for coffee shops and food courts)
- Staff can confirm completion in the system

This flexibility supports both table-service cafés and self-pickup ordering environments.
